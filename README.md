# 🏦 Bank Loan Analysis (Python)
Comprehensive analysis of bank loan performance and borrower behaviour using Python for data processing 
## Project Overview
The Bank Loan Analysis project provides an end-to-end analysis of bank loan data to understand lending performance, repayment patterns, and borrower risk levels.
Using Python, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generate visual insights that help financial institutions make data-driven decisions.
## Project Objectives
- Analyze overall and monthly loan funding performance.
- Track repayments and default patterns.
- Evaluate portfolio quality through Good vs. Bad Loan metrics.
- Support business decisions on credit policy and risk management.
