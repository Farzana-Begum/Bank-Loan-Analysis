# 🏦 Bank Loan Analysis (Python)
Comprehensive analysis of bank loan performance and borrower behaviour using Python for data processing 
## Project Overview
The Bank Loan Analysis project provides an end-to-end analysis of bank loan data to understand lending performance, repayment patterns, and borrower risk levels.
Using Python, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generate visual insights that help financial institutions make data-driven decisions.
## Project Objectives
- Analyze overall and monthly loan funding performance.
- Track repayments and default patterns.
- Evaluate portfolio quality through Good vs. Bad Loan metrics.
- Support business decisions on credit policy and risk management.
## Data used
[DataSet](https://github.com/Farzana-Begum/Bank-Loan-Analysis/blob/main/financial_loan.xlsx)
## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA))
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code (Development environment).
- Excel / CSV (Source data format)
- GitHub
## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Data Loading – Imported CSV using pandas.
- Handled missing values, removed duplicates, fixed datatypes.
- Created new columns like Total funded amount, Total amount received, Average interest rate.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze loan amount, interest rate, funded amount, and income levels distribution.
- Compare relationships between loan status and variables such as loan amount, interest rate, and DTI ratio.
## Correlation Analysis
## Questions and Key (KPIs)

## Project Insights
- Identify high-risk borrower segments based on DTI or credit score.
- Determine top factors influencing loan default or approval.
## Final Conclusion
